## Project owners

This project has been completely developed by these three University students:

## Tools used during this project

Currently, we will be using **python** with the help of some external libraries, such as Numpy to interpret all the data as well as visualize it.

All the Data will be stored as a **CSV file**, this will give us the flexibility to used some other external tools during the future of this project.
