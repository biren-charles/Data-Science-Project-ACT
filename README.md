# Data Science Project – ACT  
**University of Luxembourg – Semester 4**

## Project Description

This project was developed for the *Data Science* class.

**Dataset**:  
We are using a transactional dataset containing all transactions that occurred between **01/12/2010** and **09/12/2011** for a UK-based, non-store online retailer.  
The company primarily sells unique, all-occasion gifts. Many of its customers are wholesalers.

> ⚠️ The website providing the dataset states that there are **no missing values** – this claim will be verified during the analysis.

## Tools Used

We will be working primarily with **Python**, making use of several external libraries such as:

- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** – for data visualization  

All data will be stored in **CSV format**, which allows us the flexibility to use additional external tools throughout the project as needed.
