## Improving Data Quality and Extracting Insights from Online Retail Transactions  
*A Structured Data Science Approach*

---

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, **data science** has become a foundational pillar of modern technology and business strategy. The widespread availability of digital data, combined with advances in computing and algorithms, allows organizations to uncover patterns, predict behaviors, and make data-driven decisions.

At the heart of data science lies the ability to efficiently **preprocess and analyze structured data**, particularly transactional data.

This project applies core data science techniques to a real-world dataset from a **UK-based online retailer**, covering transactions between **December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011**. Key data fields include:

- Invoice numbers  
- Item descriptions  
- Quantities  
- Unit prices  
- Customer identifiers

---

## 2. Project Aim

The goal of this project is to:

- Demonstrate how **data preprocessing improves data quality**
- Extract **business insights** through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Apply course concepts such as:
  - Regular expressions
  - Edit distance
  - Dictionary-based feature extraction

### Focus Areas:

- Cleaning and transforming structured data for accuracy and consistency  
- Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers  
- Feature extraction (e.g., **revenue per transaction**, **product frequency**)  
- Visualizing customer behavior and sales trends  
- Applying **NLP techniques** to clean and analyze item descriptions

## 3. Dataset Overview

The dataset contains ~**500,000 transaction records**, including the following fields:

| Field         | Description                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `InvoiceNo`   | Unique identifier for each transaction  |
| `StockCode`   | Unique product code                     |
| `Description` | Product name/description                |
| `Quantity`    | Number of units purchased               |
| `InvoiceDate` | Date and time of transaction            |
| `UnitPrice`   | Price per unit                          |
| `CustomerID`  | Unique customer identifier              |
| `Country`     | Country of the customer                 |

> This dataset offers a realistic context for **data preparation and visualization**, with applications in e-commerce, marketing, and retail analytics.
